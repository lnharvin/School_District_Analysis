# School District Analysis

## Project Overview
Help a mock school board analyze school district data. Here is the list of requested deliverables: 

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
- Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
- The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
- The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
- School performance based on the budget per student
- School performance based on the school size 
- School performance based on the type of school

## Summary / Results
After removing the 9th grade math/reading scores for Thomas High School, the math, reading and overall score increased by more than 30%.

## Challenge Overview
School analysis project using Python, Anaconda and Jupyter Notebook

## Challenge Summary
This module was a challenge to the end, it was exciting to analyis the school district results into bite size portions of information that would be useful for any board. This module was practical and easy to double check your results. While formatting python code is still a work in progress I enjoyed this and look forward to building on what I've learned so far.
